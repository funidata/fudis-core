Fudis Core is a style library which provides design assets, such as design tokens and mixins, as well as individual component styles.

**Tokens** are the basic building blocks of the design system. They store e.g. color, spacing and typography decisions for the visual style of the design system.

**Mixins** are groups of different tokens combined into reusable pieces.

**Component styles** can be used through CSS classes and it will provide the same look and feel as in Fudis component library. Note that when using only styles, it does not guarantee the accessibility of the component.
