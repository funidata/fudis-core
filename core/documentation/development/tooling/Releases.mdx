# Releases

New versions are published to NPM using GitHub Releases. After tagging and creating a release on GitHub, an automatic workflow handles packaging and publishing Core to NPM.

## Versioning

Core uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

### Patch

Patch updates are interchangeable, meaning clients can upgrade or downgrade freely between versions.\
**Example:** Bug fix, interval tweak.

### Minor

Minor updates are compatible with previous versions and usually includes additional features.\
**Example:** New features, old features declared as deprecated.

### Major

Major changes are backward incompatible and will have breaking changes.\
**Example:** Changes in API endpoint name, remove of an endpoint.

## Release Notes

Release notes for each release can be found from [Github Core Releases](https://github.com/funidata/fudis-core/releases).

## Release Flow

### Create New Release

- Create new release branch from main with respective naming `release-{major.minor.patch}`
- Increment version by running `npm version <major.minor.patch>` in project root
  > This will increment version number in `package.json` files and do automatic commit of the changed files
- Create Pull Request
- Merge created Pull Request
- Go to project's GitHub main page **Releases**
- Select **Draft a new release**
- Select **Choose a tag**. Create new tag in the format of `{major.minor.patch}`
- If necessary choose from **Previous tag** dropdown, the version you want to compare to. Otherwise, use default 'Previous tag: auto'
- Select **Generate release notes**
- Replace **What's Changed** heading with a current date
- Check from **Preview** that everything looks correct
- Check correct release checkbox:

  > Set as pre-release if it is e.g. release candidate for major release

  > Set as latest if it is the newest stable release

- Publish release
- Check that [Fudis Core NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@funidata/fudis-core) has updated the newly released version

### Patch Previous Major

- Checkout to the existing **tag** and create new branch with respective naming `release-{major.minor.patch}`
- Create another branch from the release branch where the issue is fixed
- We also recommend that version increment `npm version <major.minor.patch>` is done in its own branch
- Create pull requests and merge
- Make the release from GitHub UI with the same steps as when creating new release but remember to choose correct comparison tags
- Choose **Target** branch according to the release you are updating
- Uncheck both release checkboxes since this is a fix for previously released version
- Publish release and check that the release is listen in [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@funidata/fudis-core)

### Problems After Releasing

NPM does not allow modifying published packages to protect downstream dependents. If there is something wrong with a published version, you should release a new version incrementing the version as appropriate.

For extreme cases, there exists an option to unpublish a package from NPM. This should be a last resort as it will break any downstream projects depending on the unpublished version. Note that even unpublishing will not allow you to use the same version again in a release, i.e., it is not a workaround to overwrite a published package. See [NPM Unpublish documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/policies/unpublish).

If something goes wrong in the release pipeline before the package has been published to NPM, you should anyhow increment the version and create a new release. This provides clarity and consistency to other Core developers as well as users of the library. Please also refrain from removing releases from GitHub and rather edit the release notes to make clear what has gone wrong and that the package should not be used. The bad code will anyway be forever available in the public repository so it is better to have the problems documented in release notes and thus provide an "audit trail" to users rather than undue surprises.

### Refreshing NPM Tokens

The GitHub Actions workflow resposible for publishing new Core releases to the NPM registry uses a token to authenticate against NPM. This token has a maximum lifetime of one year and will need to be re-created once it has expired. The current token will expire on May 13, 2026.

To create a new publishing token:

1. make sure you are a member of the `@funidata` organisation on NPM
2. go to your account page on NPM (click your avatar and then _Account_)
3. go to the _Access Tokens_ view
4. click _Generate New Token_ and select _Granular Access Token_
5. give the new token a descriptive name
6. select an expiration date (by selecting _Custom_ you can, at most, select a date one year from now)
7. under _Packages and scopes_ and _Permissions_, select _Read and write_ from the drop-down menu
8. select _Only select packages and scopes_, and then from the drop-down, select `@funidata/fudis-core`
9. click _Generate token_ and copy the provided token

To update the token used in GitHub Actions:

1. go to [github.com/funidata/fudis/settings/secrets/actions](https://github.com/funidata/fudis-core/settings/secrets/actions)
2. under _Repository secrets_, find `NPM_TOKEN` and click the edit icon
3. paste in the copied token and click _Update secret_

Note that you should only copy the token from NPM to your clipboard and never save it anywhere even temporarily. The token grants full write privileges to `@funidata/fudis-core` and has to be treated accordingly.

Also note that the token's permissions on NPM should include read and write permissions only to the `@funidata/fudis-core` package and nothing else. There should be no organization-level permissions chosen.
