## Developing Process and Version Controls Practises

Fudis Core Style Library is an open-source project for maintaining and developing a design system for Funidata's web applications.
With each new version release, developer documentation is deployed to public Storybook and style library as public [package to NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@funidata/fudis-core). More in depth designs guidelines are maintained in Funidata's private Figma account for the use of Funidata's other products.

Code review is an important step in Fudis development process to get a second opinion on the solution and implementation. Pull requests cannot be merged before other core developer has approved it.

Fudis coding standards ensure uniformity across codebase, making it easier for developers to read, understand, and maintain code.

Fudis uses GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines in delivering newer version of the library. The secret keys required to run various CI/CD actions can only be managed by repository's administrators. GitHub's provided tools e.g. CodeQL analysis and Secret scanning is enabled to automatically catch and prevent possible vulnerabilities.

## Testing Practices

All repository's components and functionalities are expected to have visual regression E2E tests. Tests are always run with each pull request, after merging PR to main branch and when running NPM package release script. If tests fail merging and deployment is halted until failed checks are resolved.

## Service Deployment

Setting up the development environment instructions in [Getting Started-section.](/docs/documentation-introduction-how-to-start-using-fudis-core--docs)

## Data Handling

Fudis does not have any backend services. Sensitive data is not used in developing and testing, only fake mock data.

## Dependencies

- Chosen third party libraries are widely supported and well maintained.
- Depedencies are updated frequently, roughly once a month.
