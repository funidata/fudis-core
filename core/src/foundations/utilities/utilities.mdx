# Utilities

Load Core mixins and tokens to your SCSS file with:

```
@use "@funidata/fudis-core" as core;
```

## Visually-hidden

Use this helper to visually hide element but keep it accessible to assistive technologies.

Use as a mixin:

```
.my-element {
  @include core.visually-hidden;
}
```

Use as a class name:

```
<div class="fudis-visually-hidden">You cannot see me!</div>
```

## Box-reset

Use this helper, if you want to reset your CSS-enviroment. This sets the box-sizing property to border-box and sets margin and padding to 0.

Use as a mixin:

```
.my-element {
  @include core.box-reset;
}
```

Use as a class name:

```
<div class="fudis-box-reset">Now the browser accounts border and padding in the values you specify for an element's width and height!</div>
```
